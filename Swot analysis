My Strengths: 

-I have an open mind and I am not only willing but also quite enjoy the process of putting ideas to scrutiny.

-I am task focused, passionate about pairing problems with their best solutions.

-I work well with a team, and I love the product development process. 

My Weaknesses (and how I am working on them):

-I am apt to bounce between projects or ideas when given the freedom (The Agile frameworks have improved this aspect of my work drastically, giving me tools to manage myself)

-I lose track of things in my schedule and/or forget ideas (I am mitigating this by using a planner and keeping notes, and while it's not perfect it has helped)

-I've aware that I enjoy the process of argumentation and having my ideas scrutinized where others do not. (I am working on strategies to better recognize when I need to take an alternative approach to introducing my solutions)


Some Opportunites:

-I believe I recognize a very large market that is currently under-served in the software space, and I am very exciteed to explore what kind of solutions can be provided. 

-I am always excited to grow, and I am hoping that I can find a company that I can grow and change with. 

-I am a full-stack developer and I am sure I have the great opportunity to be able to interact with software at any point in it's lifecycle


Some Threats:

-I am currently held back by a the complexity of my projects, for a single developer it's makes my habit of jumping from project to project even harder to manage.

-Losing a good idea is a threat I am always aware of, and I have begun to write nearly everything down because I'd hate for that idea to just dissapear.
